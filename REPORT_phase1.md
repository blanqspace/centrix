# Centrix — Phase 1 Smoke & Stability Report

## Zusammenfassung
- Ergebnis: WARN
- Datum/Zeit: 2025-10-20T01:44:55+02:00
- Umgebung: Python 3.12.3 (`runtime/reports/pyver.txt`), Linux 6.6.87.2-microsoft-standard-WSL2 #1 SMP PREEMPT_DYNAMIC Thu Jun  5 18:30:46 UTC 2025

## Checkliste
- Installation/Packaging: OK (`runtime/reports/pip_check.txt`, `runtime/reports/pkg_import.txt`)
- Linter/Typecheck/Tests: OK (`runtime/reports/ruff.txt`, `runtime/reports/black.txt`, `runtime/reports/mypy.txt`, `runtime/reports/pytest.txt`)
- Runtime-Struktur: OK (`runtime/logs/centrix.log` updated)
- Dashboard Health (/healthz): OK (`runtime/reports/healthz.json`)
- Worker Heartbeat: OK (`runtime/logs/centrix.log` heartbeat entries)
- TUI Headless-Start: OK (`runtime/reports/tui_run.txt`)
- systemd Verify: OK (`runtime/reports/systemd_verify.txt`)
- tmux Starter: WARN (`runtime/reports/tmux_run.txt`)

## Details & Artefakte
- ruff: clean scan; no findings (`runtime/reports/ruff.txt`)
- black: style compliance confirmed (`runtime/reports/black.txt`)
- mypy: strict type-check clean (`runtime/reports/mypy.txt`)
- pytest: 5 passed / 0 failed (`runtime/reports/pytest.txt`)
- pip check: dependency tree healthy (`runtime/reports/pip_check.txt`)
- Dashboard /healthz: `{"ok":true}` (`runtime/reports/healthz.json`)
- Worker run: silent stdout; activity visible in log (`runtime/reports/worker_run.txt`)
- TUI run: timed headless launch captured (`runtime/reports/tui_run.txt`)
- Dashboard launch log: uvicorn startup/shutdown (`runtime/reports/dashboard_run.txt`)
- systemd verify: no diagnostics emitted (`runtime/reports/systemd_verify.txt`)
- tmux starter: `open terminal failed` in non-interactive shell (`runtime/reports/tmux_run.txt`)
- Logfile: see latest entries in `runtime/logs/centrix.log`

## Befunde
- tmux smoke test could not attach in the non-interactive QA shell (`open terminal failed`). Session teardown succeeded, but interactive validation is pending.

## Maßnahmen/Nächste Schritte (für Phase 2/3)
- ❑ Add a non-interactive flag to `tools/tmux_centrix.sh` to allow detached smoke testing without tmux attach.
- ❑ Extend worker smoke coverage with explicit approval expiry/assertion logs for better observability.
- ❑ Capture structured TUI output (e.g., via textual screenshot/log export) to ease automated verification.
